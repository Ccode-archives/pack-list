# pack-list
package listing for reppack.  
If you have a package that you want to put in the package manager then this is the data syntax.  
# Comments
Comments start with `$`.
# Data entry
```
<package name> ^ <repo url>
```
`^` works as a data assigner, `package name` is the value name, and `repo url` is the value.
